## About the project

DATA-KBR-BE will optimise KBR’s existing ICT infrastructure in order to facilitate sustainable data-level access to KBR’s digitised collections for digital humanities research. For this project, research teams at Ghent University and the University of Antwerp will work closely together with the collection, digitisation and ICT experts at KBR to co-design two interdisciplinary research scenarios that will extract relevant thematic datasets from BelgicaPress (KBR’s digitised historical newspaper collection - [https://www.kbr.be/en/belgica-press/](https://www.kbr.be/en/belgica-press/)) for reuse and analysis in the field of digital humanities.

## IDLab role

Within this project IDLab Ghent will share his expertise on the following project submodules:

- Image to text translation of historical newspapers
- Knowledge extraction from the extracted newspaper texts
- Knowledge clustering/reasoning and the compilation of the knowledge in a dataset
