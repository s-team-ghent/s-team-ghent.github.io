## About the project

DATA-KBR-BE will optimise KBR’s existing ICT infrastructure in order to facilitate sustainable data-level access to KBR’s digitised collections for digital humanities research. For this project, research teams at Ghent University and the University of Antwerp will work closely together with the collection, digitisation and ICT experts at KBR to co-design two interdisciplinary research scenarios that will extract relevant thematic datasets from BelgicaPress (KBR’s digitised historical newspaper collection - [https://www.kbr.be/en/belgica-press/](https://www.kbr.be/en/belgica-press/)) for reuse and analysis in the field of digital humanities.

## IDLab role

IDLab will mainly focus on document layout analysis and group text blocks/boxes into articles based on layout features, textual features, and semantic content similiarity. This annotation at a higher semantic level should improve the querying mechanisms of the KBR tools. The Newspaper Navigator of The Library of Congress [https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator) will be used as a starting point for this research.
