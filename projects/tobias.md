## About the project

The TOBIAS project, in collaboration with leading steel manufacturing companies, helps to transition the steel industry towards Industry 4.0. A variety of sensor data is captured at different points in the production line. This data is analyzed using data science and machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and predict failures in advance. This leads to an increased manufacturing efficiency by preventing downtime and decreases waste of resources and energy.

## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within TOBIAS:

* Research and compare different vision technologies to find the optimal hardware setup for the defined problem
* Extract features from images to visualize, support human desicion making or further process automatically
* Detect anomalies and predict failures at different stages in the production process
