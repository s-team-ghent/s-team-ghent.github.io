## About the project

The TOBIAS project, in collaboration with leading steel manufacturing companies, aims to help transition the steel industry towards Industry 4.0. A variety of data sources are analysed using data science and machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and predict failures in advance. This leads to an increased manufacturing efficiency by preventing downtime due to failure and by decreasing waste of resources and energy. This in turn leads to higher quality products that meet the rising demands of customers.

## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within TOBIAS:

* Research and compare different vision technologies to find the optimal hardware setup for the defined problem
* Extract features from images to visualize, support human desicion making or further process automatically
* Detect anomalies and predict failures at different stages in the production process
