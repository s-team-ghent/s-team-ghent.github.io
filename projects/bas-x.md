## About the project

Project in collaboration with [RouteYou](https://www.routeyou.com/) with the goal to analyze and improve the quality of their walking & cycling routes, while also developing tools to automatically extract new routes from raster maps. Through statistical analysis of real user data and correlation with other datasets (e.g. weather, road type) the route information can be updated to more accurately reflect the real world conditions. For instance, the platform can suggest detours when it has been raining recently, to avoid more dangerous and uncomfortable sections in the route.

By automatically generating an approximate route based on raster maps, walking and cycling routes from other agencies can more easily be integrated into the Routeyou platform. A real-world demonstrator could be made, where a user takes a picture of a map found on the roadside and it returns the approximate route. This enables gps navigation for that route and extends the Routeyou database. 


## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within BAS-X

- Digitization and extraction of walking and cycling routes through computer vision techniques
- Correlation study between route popularity and the route characteristics
- Improving route metadata based on user generated data
