## About the project

The KOERS project is a cultural heritage project in collaboration with [Koers museum Roeselare](https://koersmuseum.be/nl). The project tries to improve traditional cycling broadcasting by implementation of a second-screen application which links with the displayed cycling race. The viewer is presented with interesting cycling heritage from the museum's collection whilst watching the race.

## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within the software oriented packages of the KOERS project

- Content processing and indexing: help the museum with digitalizing, annotating and indexing their cultural heritage
- Content - broadcast linking: show relevant content at the right moment in time (e.g. jersey of rider which is currently being shown, monument nearby the peloton's location)
