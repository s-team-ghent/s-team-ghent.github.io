## About the project
PACE is an algorithm/tool that quantifies the energetic reserve capacity of the body during exercise. Individuals performing exercise obtain real-time feedback on their energetic balance. PACE integrates data registered during training (power output/speed or heart rate) and matches these data to the individual exercise capacity.

## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within the PACE project
* Visualisation of the PACE algorithm
* Get real time feedback on body battery status based on ANT+ sensor input and athlete profile
