# A dashboard to support coaches of track cyclists in analyzing and visualizing real-time sensor data.

## About the project
User-friendly dashboard to support coaches in monitoring their athletes during indoor cycling, able to capture, analyze and visualize sensor data. The dashboard is extensible with different modules such
as signal-strength (RSSI) based zone localisation, PACE body battery and so on.

To develop a user-friendly dashboard to support coaches in monitoring their athletes during indoor cycling, and to be able to capture, analyze and visualize sensor data. To use all available ANT+ enabled sensors of the athletes (power, cadence, heart rate,â€¦) and capture them in different zones on the track using off-the-shelf hardware. 
To develop an innovative signal strength-based methodology to perform localization. To build tools to automatically detect and evaluate specific events (e.g. madison change) and identify outliers.

## IDLab role
IDLab has the following tasks within the WCN project
* Setup of infrastructure to capture and distribute ANT+ sensor values to data consumers
* Dashboard to process, analyze and report collected sensor data
