# A dashboard to support coaches of track cyclists in analyzing and visualizing real-time sensor data.

## About the project
The main goals of the project are:
* To develop a user-friendly dashboard to support coaches in monitoring their athletes during indoor cycling, and to be able to capture, analyze and visualize sensor data. The dashboard is extensible with different modules such as signal-strength (RSSI) based zone localisation, [PACE body battery](https://s-team-ghent.github.io/projects/PACE.html), ...
* To use all available ANT+ enabled sensors of the athletes (power, cadence, heart rate, â€¦) and capture them in different zones on the track using off-the-shelf hardware.
* To develop an innovative signal strength-based methodology to perform localization.
* To build tools to automatically detect and evaluate specific events (e.g. madison change) and identify outliers.

## IDLab role
IDLab has the following tasks within the WCN project:
* Setup of infrastructure to capture and distribute ANT+ sensor values to data consumers, linked with MyLaps timing data to accurately assess performance.
* Create dashboard to process, analyze and report collected sensor data.
* The development of a camera setup to capture video footage of exercises and events by tracking riders using MyLaps data for localization. This allows fully automated creation of clips of interest to the coaches and athletes, and present these inside the dashboard.
* Implement data and video analysis methods as requested by coaches and athletes, for example analyzing the quality of changeovers during a team-pursuit run.
