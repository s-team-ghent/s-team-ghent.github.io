## About the project

Project in collaboration with [ReVaKi Ugent](https://www.ugent.be/ge/revaki/nl) and a number of Belgian Pro League football clubs. Within the project we look at the effects of load on injury risk and we try to model injury risk with the help of both in-season and pre-season testdata from the football clubs.

## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within the CLUBS project

- Data clean(s)ing of the datadumps from the football clubs
- Injury risk prediction by machine learning techniques
