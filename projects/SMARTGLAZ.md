## About the project

The SmartGLAZ ICON project is a collaborative effort between IDLab Ghent/Antwerp and some industry partners in which we try to implement a new type of heads-up-display (HUD) specially designed for motorcyclists. The projects consists of both hardware and software work packages.

## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within the software oriented packages of the SmartGLAZ project

- Distortion detection and correction: algorithms that can detect and correct the image projected on the HUD 
- Routing and navigation building blocks tailored for motorcyclist and built around user preferences and road-scene complexity estimation models.
