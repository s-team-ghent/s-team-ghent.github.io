## About the project
The BRIEK project, short for "Better Routing with Interactive Elements in KOERS," focuses on improving visitor navigation and experience at [KOERS, the Museum of Cycling](https://koersmuseum.be/nl). The project addresses current challenges in wayfinding within the museum, which are partly due to the protected status and complex layout of the building. By leveraging advanced technology, BRIEK aims to create a more accessible and engaging experience for visitors.

## IDLab role
IDLab has the following tasks during the BRIEK project:

- **Location tracking and analytics**: Implementing Wi-Fi fingerprinting technology to accurately track visitor movements within the museum. This technology is used to generate heatmaps and detailed movement trajectories, enabling the museum to analyze and optimize wayfinding.

- **Interactive avatar development**: Designing 3D avatars of renowned cyclists using the museumâ€™s digital archive. These avatars, combined with synthesized voices, aim to provide personalized and interactive guidance to enhance the visitor experience.
