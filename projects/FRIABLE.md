## FRIABLE
## About the project
Preserving works of art created with FRIABLE media, such as black chalk, chalk, charcoal and pastel, is a challenge
for museums and curators. The KMSKB (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) has a valuable collection
of approximately 1800 FRIABLE works of art, of which 200 are considered full-fledged works of art. These works of art
are fragile and require special care and attention to maintain their long-term integrity.

The FRIABLE project, initiated by the KMSKB, aims to improve the conservation of FRIABLE works of art
through research and documentation. One of the important aspects of this project is preparing damage reports
for each work of art, documenting its current condition and any damage. The current process
However, completing damage reports on paper is time-consuming and makes it difficult to process the collected data
analyze and use for future research.

## IDLab role
The aim of this project is to develop a tool with which damage reports can be efficiently digitized.
The tool offers a user-friendly interface for completing damage reports, where the data is displayed immediately
are stored digitally. This makes the data easier to analyze, interpret and reuse.

In addition, the tool ensures that the data is available in various digital formats, such as an SQL database,
PDFs, CSV files and an RDF endpoint. This facilitates the integration of the data into other applications and enables
further analysis and visualization possible.

The development of this tool contributes to the KMSKB's FRIABLE project by accelerating and simplifying it
of the damage reporting process. It allows conservators to record accurate and detailed data
about the condition of FRIABLE artworks, providing better insight into their vulnerability and conservation
these work. Furthermore, the tool offers opportunities for future research and the development of conservation protocols.
With this research and the development of the tool, this thesis hopes to make a valuable contribution to the efforts
of the KMSKB to improve the preservation and accessibility of FRIABLE works of art. In addition, the
tool serve as a model for other museums and institutions facing similar challenges
the preservation of fragile works of art.
