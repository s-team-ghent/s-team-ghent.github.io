## About the project
The proposed interdisciplinary EURECA (EUropean Region Enrichment in City Archives and collections) project follows the trends towards location based services (LBS) and personalized/contextualized content, and investigates them in the context of cultural heritage collections of European city archives and collections. We focus on finding traces (or origins/influences) of European regions that have shaped the cities in which we live today and will develop tools to easily explore them when visiting a city. Different historical, architectural, economic, political and cultural reasons form the base of these traces, and we will use input from each of these domains to reveal the cultural heritage items that can be linked to these specific European regions/origins. The enriched metadata that will be generated for the city archives and collections can be used as input to perform new fundamental research and applied studies, but also to facilitate the exploitation of the collections to a broader public and attract new groups of cultural heritage consumers.
