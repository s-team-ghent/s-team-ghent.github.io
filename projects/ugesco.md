## About the project
The Ugesco project will develop geo-temporal (meta)data extraction and enrichment tools to extend and link the existing collection items and facilitate spatio-temporal collection mapping for interactive querying. In order to optimize the quality of the temporal and spatial annotations that are retrieved by our automatic enrichment tools, the UGESCO project investegated the added value of microtask crowdsourcing in validating and improving the generated metadata.

## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within the UGESCO project

1. Crowdsourcing
