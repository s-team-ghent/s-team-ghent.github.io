title: 'HYBRID AI FOR BUILDINGS'
---

## About the project
Today's modern buildings produce and provide a whole range of valuable data from HVAC systems, environmental sensors, BIM models, etc. This project focusses on bringing all these data sources together to improve building management using knowledge-driven and data-driven techniques.


## IDLab role
IDLab has the following tasks within the Hybrid AI for buildings project:
* Knowledge-based stream processing use cases combining all available building information.
* Data-driven presence detection using environmental sensors.
