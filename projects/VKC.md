## About the project
In collaboration with the Vlaamse Kunstcollectie en GhentCDH, IDLab is active in the VKC Enriched project, which focuses on automatic enrichment of digital collections within the Flemish fine art museums. The project currently focuses on 2 use cases. The first of those attempts to build an exposition history for the individual artworks based on historic exposition catalogues. To achieve this, we make use of OCR, NLP and NER. Within the second case, the project researches how Machine Learning can be applied to automatically detect iconographic concepts in a wide array of artworks.
## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within the VKC project

1. Development of a OCR/NLP/NER pipeline which can automatically extract interesting information from historical exposition catalogues.
2. Research of a Machine Learning model which can be employed to detect iconographic concepts in artworks
