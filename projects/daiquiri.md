## About the project

DAIQUIRI will develop a **media-focused sensor data platform and professional dashboard** allowing content creators to augment live sports experiences. DAIQUIRI targets both **real-time augmentation of live TV** and **near-live story snippet inserts in an interactive set-top-box application layer**. The project demonstrator will showcase end-to-end sensor data integration for reporting of hockey and cyclocross. The consortium covers the full value chain bringing together unique expertise in sports event capturing (Videohouse, NEP), enriched sensor data platform (InTheRace, Arinti, imec-IDLab), editorial tooling and storytelling (VRT) and interactive user experiences in a living room environment (Telenet, imec-MICT).

## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within the DAIQUIRI project:

- **Video-sensor matching and metadata enrichment**: Research will be targeted to accurate player/action recognition in both modalities. This enrichment process should facilitate automatic video summarization and race/match analysis.  
- **Semantifying of sensor data and semantic/federated querying**: Research will be targeted to intelligent streams analysis and summarisation, as well as efficient querying of semantically enhanced both real-time and historical data.
