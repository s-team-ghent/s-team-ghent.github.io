## About the project

On May 13, 2024, 13 winter sports innovation projects were submitted to Sport Innovator. One of the successful projects comes from Short Track Speed Skating. After six months of hard work, the relay project is in full swing. The focus is mainly on the relays, which is an important pillar to take Dutch Short Track to a higher level.

RE(P)LAY is a great collaboration between the KNSB, Ghent University and the University of Groningen. The strength of this project lies in the unique combination of sensor and camera data, which enables detailed and direct feedback on the ice. In addition to this direct feedback, RE(P)LAY offers coaches the opportunity to perform in-depth analyses.

## IDLab role

The role of IDLab is mainly to facilitate the automatic event tagging in video and to build an interactive dashboard to identify particular relays that can be improved.
