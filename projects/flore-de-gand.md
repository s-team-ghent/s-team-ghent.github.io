## About the project
This heritage project focuses on digitization, enrichment and cross collection linking of bound historical herbaria. RAW images with control strip and barcodes are automatically converted into a 'composition' (TIFF). For this purpose, scripts were developed that can detect / analyze the page, control strip and barcodes based on the RAW images. This procedure automatically improves the quality of the image if necessary (and checks it for focus / white balance / etc.). The link with the inventory is also made via the barcodes, so that the metadata is linked to the digital image. The herbarium sheet is also automatically straightened (see figure below - image on the right) so that it can be offered digitally under optimal conditions for further investigation / consultation. The pages were also optionally de-warped which was found to improve OCR results.


## IDLab role

IDLab has the following tasks within the Flore De Gand project

1. Developed a novel page detection algorithm for preprocessing of the scanned pages.
2. Currently building a interactive smart table for crowd sourced scanning and enrichment of historical images.
